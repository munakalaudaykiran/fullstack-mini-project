\# Full Stack Mini Project – Facts App



\## 1. How I developed this application

I developed the backend using Django REST Framework to create a REST API

that returns a hardcoded list of facts in JSON format. The frontend was

developed using React (Vite) and fetches data from the backend API and

displays the data in a simple user interface. I tested the application

locally and ensured proper communication between frontend and backend

using CORS configuration.



\## 2. What I learnt from this exercise

\- Building REST APIs using Django REST Framework

\- Creating frontend applications using React

\- Connecting frontend and backend using HTTP requests

\- Understanding basic full-stack application structure

\- Using Git and GitHub for version control
